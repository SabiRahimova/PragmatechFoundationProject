        Ancient Egyptian culture flourished between c. 5500 BCE with the rise of technology and 30 BCE with the death of Cleopatra VII. Historians usually group the history of Ancient Egypt into three major kingdoms called the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. It was during these times that Ancient Egypt was at its strongest.

    In ancient, Religion was an integral part of the daily life of every Egyptian.  As ancient Egyptian rulers, pharaohs were both the heads of state and the religious leaders of their people. As the religious leader of the Egyptians, the pharaoh was considered the divine intermediary between the gods and Egyptians..

 As a statesman, the pharaoh made laws, waged war, collected taxes, and oversaw all the land in Egypt . Pharaohs were typically male, although there were some noteworthy female leaders, like Hatshepsut and CleopatraAfter their deaths, many pharaohs were entombed and surrounded by riches they were meant to use in the afterlife.
